# RL_Strategic_code
A research project supervised by Professor Kishor Bharti. This project uses reinforcement learning, specifically OpenAI SpinningUp, to design the "interrogator" in a dynamical
quantum error correction framework. The reinforcement learning assisted neural network helps to build quantum adaptive codes based on a unified spatio-temporal framework proved in https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17567.
